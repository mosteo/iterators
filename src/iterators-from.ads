package Iterators.From with Pure is

   --  Root package for generics that make available iterators starting from a
   --  standard Ada container. Available features will vary slightly depending
   --  on the actual container:
   --  * Iteration: available for all containers.
   --  * Indexing: available for vectors/maps (TODO: trees).
   --  * Collecting: available for all containers.
